# Futu Trading Adapter for Foxtrot

This directory contains the Futu trading adapter implementation for the Foxtrot trading platform, providing integration with Futu Securities for trading across Hong Kong, US, and China markets using the official Futu OpenAPI.

## Architecture Overview

The adapter follows the **OpenD Gateway Pattern** with the official Futu Python SDK:

```
Foxtrot Application
       â†“
   FutuAdapter  
       â†“
   futu Python SDK
       â†“
   OpenD Gateway (Local)
       â†“
   Futu Servers (Remote)
```

### Key Features

- **Multi-Market Support**: Hong Kong (SEHK), US (NASDAQ/NYSE), China (SZSE/SSE)
- **OpenD Gateway**: Local gateway at 127.0.0.1:11111 for all communications
- **RSA Authentication**: Secure key-based authentication instead of API key/secret
- **Callback-Driven**: Real-time data processing via SDK callbacks
- **Thread-Safe**: All operations designed for concurrent access
- **Existing Exchange Integration**: Uses existing VT exchanges instead of creating new ones

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```python
default_setting = {
    # OpenD Gateway Settings
    "Host": "127.0.0.1",                    # Local OpenD gateway
    "Port": 11111,                          # Standard OpenD port
    "RSA Key File": "conn_key.txt",         # RSA private key file
    "Connection ID": "",                    # Unique connection identifier
    
    # Trading Settings

    "Trading Password": "",                 # For trade context unlock
    "Paper Trading": True,
    
    # Market Access
    "HK Market Access": True,
    "US Market Access": True, 
    "CN Market Access": False,             # May require special permissions
    
    # Connection Management
    "Connect Timeout": 30,
    "Reconnect Interval": 10,
    "Max Reconnect Attempts": 5,
    "Keep Alive Interval": 30,
    
    # Market Data
    "Market Data Level": "L1",
    "Max Subscriptions": 200,

}
```

### Supported Exchanges

The adapter integrates with existing Foxtrot exchanges:
- **SEHK**: Hong Kong Stock Exchange
- **NASDAQ**: NASDAQ Stock Exchange
- **NYSE**: New York Stock Exchange
- **SZSE**: Shenzhen Stock Exchange
- **SSE**: Shanghai Stock Exchange

## Symbol Format

### VT Symbol Convention
All symbols follow the standard VT format: `{symbol}.{exchange}`

**Examples:**
- Hong Kong: `"0700.SEHK"` (Tencent Holdings)
- US NASDAQ: `"AAPL.NASDAQ"` (Apple Inc.)
- US NYSE: `"SPY.NYSE"` (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)
- China SZSE: `"000001.SZSE"` (Ping An Bank)
- China SSE: `"600036.SSE"` (China Merchants Bank)

### Futu SDK Format Conversion
The adapter automatically converts between VT and Futu SDK formats:

```python
VT Format      â†’  Futu SDK Format
"0700.SEHK"    â†’  ("HK", "HK.00700")
"AAPL.NASDAQ"  â†’  ("US", "US.AAPL")
"000001.SZSE"  â†’  ("CN", "CN.000001")
```

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
1. **OpenD Gateway**: Must be installed and running locally
2. **Futu API SDK**: Already integrated via `futu-api` package
3. **RSA Keys**: Required for authentication
4. **Market Access**: Appropriate permissions for desired markets

### Setup Steps (For Production Use)
1. Install and configure OpenD gateway
2. Generate RSA key pair for authentication
3. Configure Futu account with required market permissions
4. Set up paper trading environment for testing
5. Configure adapter settings in Foxtrot

## Usage Example

```python
from foxtrot.core.event_engine import EventEngine
from foxtrot.adapter.futu import FutuAdapter

# Create event engine
event_engine = EventEngine()

# Create adapter
adapter = FutuAdapter(event_engine, "FUTU")

# Configure settings
settings = {
    "Host": "127.0.0.1",
    "Port": 11111,
    "RSA Key File": "path/to/conn_key.txt",
    "Trading Password": "your_password",
    "Paper Trading": True,
    # ... other settings
}

# Connect to OpenD gateway
adapter.connect(settings)

# Subscribe to market data
from foxtrot.util.object import SubscribeRequest
from foxtrot.util.constants import Exchange

req = SubscribeRequest(
    symbol="0700",
    exchange=Exchange.SEHK
)
adapter.subscribe(req)

# Place an order
from foxtrot.util.object import OrderRequest
from foxtrot.util.constants import Direction, OrderType

order_req = OrderRequest(
    symbol="0700",
    exchange=Exchange.SEHK,
    direction=Direction.LONG,
    type=OrderType.LIMIT,
    volume=100,
    price=500.0
)
adapter.send_order(order_req)
```

## Performance Targets

Based on OpenD gateway architecture:
- **Market Data Latency**: <100ms (adjusted for gateway overhead)
- **Order Latency**: <200ms (SDK + gateway processing)
- **Connection Recovery**: <60s (OpenD restart time)
- **Memory Usage**: <150MB (SDK overhead included)
- **Subscription Capacity**: >200 symbols

## Development Notes

### Thread Safety
All manager operations are designed to be thread-safe with proper locking mechanisms for callback synchronization.

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error classification and recovery mechanisms are planned for Phase 7, with graceful degradation patterns.

### Testing Strategy
The adapter includes unit tests for all components, with mock SDK integration for consistent testing environments.

## Contributing

When extending the adapter:
1. Follow existing manager delegation patterns
2. Maintain thread safety in all operations
3. Use proper VT data object conversions
4. Include comprehensive error handling
5. Add appropriate unit tests
