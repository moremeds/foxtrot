# Task ID: 14
# Title: Phase 2: Create Basic Unit Tests (One per Component)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Write one simple, working test for each core component to establish baseline coverage
# Details:
Components needing tests: EventEngine (test put/get event), MainEngine (test initialization), BaseAdapter (test abstract methods), OrderData (test dataclass creation), each adapter (test connection). Keep tests simple - just verify basic functionality. No mocks initially, just instantiation tests.

# Test Strategy:
Each test must pass independently. Run with 'pytest -v' to see individual results. Target: at least 10 passing tests across core components.
