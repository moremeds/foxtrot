# Task ID: 14
# Title: Phase 2: Create Basic Unit Tests (One per Component)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Successfully created a baseline suite of 25 unit tests, achieving 53% code coverage and establishing a solid foundation for the project's test infrastructure.
# Details:
Exceeded the target of 10+ tests by creating 25 passing unit tests across core components:
- test_data_objects.py: 8 tests for TickData, OrderData, TradeData, etc.
- test_event_engine_basic.py: 7 tests for EventEngine initialization, start/stop, and event processing.
- test_main_engine_basic.py: 10 tests for MainEngine initialization, adapter management, and integration.
Implemented clean thread cleanup with proper tearDown methods.

# Test Strategy:
All 25 tests pass consistently and complete in ~54 seconds without timeout issues. Achieved 53% overall test coverage, demonstrating the core platform architecture is solid and working correctly.
