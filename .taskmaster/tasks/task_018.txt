# Title: Phase 4: Connect TUI Buttons to Actions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Make TUI buttons actually trigger events when clicked
# Details:
Currently buttons do nothing. Connect: Buy/Sell buttons to order submission, Cancel button to order cancellation, Refresh buttons to data updates. Each button press should emit an event through EventEngine. Add loading states and error feedback.

# Test Strategy:
Click each button and verify event is emitted. Check EventEngine receives correct event type. Verify UI shows feedback (loading/success/error).
