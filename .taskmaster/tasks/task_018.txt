# Task ID: 18
# Title: Phase 4: Connect TUI Buttons to Actions
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: CANCELLED: This task's functionality has been merged into Task 5.9 (Button Framework and Event Binding subtask).
# Details:
This task was cancelled because its requirements—connecting Buy/Sell, Cancel, and Refresh buttons to their respective actions via the EventEngine, including loading states and error feedback—have been consolidated into the broader TUI implementation under Task 5.9. This avoids redundant work and centralizes TUI development.

# Test Strategy:
N/A - Task cancelled. Testing for this functionality is now part of Task 5.9.
