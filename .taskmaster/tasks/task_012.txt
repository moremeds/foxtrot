# Task ID: 12
# Title: Phase 1: Eliminate Global Instances
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove all global mutable state and singleton patterns from the codebase
# Details:
Find and eliminate: global event_engine instances, global logger instances, shared mutable state in utils. Replace with dependency injection pattern. MainEngine should create and pass dependencies. No module should have side effects on import.

# Test Strategy:
Import each module independently and verify no global state is created. Mock all dependencies in tests. Verify no import side effects.
