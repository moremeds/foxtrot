# Task ID: 2
# Title: Fix all failed unit tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Fix all failed unit tests, grouping them by the reasons for failure and the classes being tested.

The following workflow must be followed:
1. Each failing test must be analyzed by examining the source code first
2. Make the necessary changes to fix the test
3. Run the tests to verify the fix works
4. Do not move on to the next test until the current one passes successfully

This systematic approach ensures each test is properly fixed before proceeding to the next one.
