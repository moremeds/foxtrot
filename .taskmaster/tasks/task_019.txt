# Task ID: 19
# Title: Phase 5: Create Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Test component interactions with real event flow
# Details:
Test scenarios: Engineâ†’Adapter order flow, Event propagation through system, Data updates triggering UI refresh, Error handling across components. Use real EventEngine but mock external connections. Test complete workflows end-to-end.

# Test Strategy:
Each integration test covers a complete user workflow. Tests should use real components where possible, mock only external APIs. Verify events flow correctly through the system.
