# Task ID: 20
# Title: Add Minimal Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Add docstrings to all public methods and classes
# Details:
One-line docstrings for simple methods, multi-line for complex ones. Include: purpose, parameters, return value, exceptions raised. Focus on public API first. Use Google style docstrings. No novels - keep it concise and practical.

# Test Strategy:
Run pydocstyle to check docstring presence. Verify all public methods have at least one-line docstring.
