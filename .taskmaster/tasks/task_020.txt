# Task ID: 20
# Title: Comprehensive Test Coverage Enhancement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Successfully stabilized the CI/CD pipeline by fixing critical flaky WebSocket and performance tests. The focus is now on resolving remaining test failures and continuing to expand coverage through new unit, integration, and E2E tests.
# Details:
Key progress includes mocking WebSocket and performance tests to eliminate timeouts, significantly reducing test execution time, and creating comprehensive tests for the DI container. The CI/CD pipeline is no longer blocked by flaky tests. Remaining work involves fixing specific WebSocket subscription failures related to `api_client` initialization and developing the planned E2E test suites.

# Test Strategy:
Success will be measured by: 1. Complete resolution of all WebSocket test failures. 2. An increase in overall test coverage percentage to the project's target, tracked via `pytest-cov`. 3. Successful integration of all new test suites (especially E2E) into the CI process. 4. Peer review of all new tests to ensure they are robust and meaningful.
