It must mirror the structure, interface, and data transformations of the existing Interactive Brokers adapter to ensure system-wide compatibility without requiring any changes to the core system.",

        "details": "The implementation should follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Project Setup:**\n    -   Create a new directory: `foxtrot/adapter/binance/`.\n    -   Add the `ccxt` library to the project's dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `package.json`).\n\n2.  **Adapter Class Structure:**\n    -   Create a `BinanceAdapter` class within the new directory that inherits from the framework's `foxtrot.gateway.BaseAdapter`.\n    -   The adapter will be initialized by the `MainEngine`, which will provide the `EventEngine` instance for event communication.\n    -   The constructor should accept API key, secret, and a flag for sandbox/testnet mode. It will initialize the `ccxt.binance()` instance.\n    -   Implement all abstract methods from `BaseAdapter`, such as: `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `send_order()`, `cancel_order()`, `query_market_data()`, `subscribe_tick()`, etc.\n\n3.  **CCXT Integration & Method Implementation:**\n    -   Use the initialized `ccxt` instance to implement the interface methods.\n    -   `connect()`: Should perform an initial authenticated call, like `fetchBalance()`, to verify credentials and then start the main data polling/streaming loop.\n    -   `send_order()`: Map the framework's `OrderRequest` object to `ccxt.createOrder()` arguments. Handle different order types and parameters.\n    -   `query_account()`: Use `ccxt.fetchBalance()` to retrieve account holdings.\n    -   `query_market_data()`: Use `ccxt.fetchOHLCV()` for historical candlestick data.\n\n4.  **Data Transformation Layer:**\n    -   Implement private helper methods to transform data between the Binance API format (via `ccxt`) and the framework's standard data objects (e.g., `OrderData`, `AccountData`, `BarData`, `TickData`).\n    -   **Symbols:** Convert from Binance format (e.g., 'BTCUSDT') to the internal format (e.g., 'BTC.USDT').\n    -   **Timestamps:** Convert millisecond epoch timestamps from `ccxt` to the application's standard format (e.g., ISO 8601 strings).\n    -   **Order Status:** Map Binance statuses ('open', 'closed', 'canceled') to the internal `OrderStatus` enum used by the foxtrot `OrderData` object.\n    -   **Numeric Types:** Use a high-precision numeric type like `Decimal` for all price and quantity values to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.\n\n5.  **Real-time Event Handling (WebSockets):**\n    -   Utilize `ccxt`'s unified WebSocket streaming methods (`watchTicker`, `watchOrders`, `watchMyTrades`).\n    -   Upon receiving a WebSocket message from `ccxt`, transform the data payload into standard `Event` objects (e.g., `TickEvent`, `OrderEvent`) containing the appropriate data objects (`TickData`, `OrderData`).\n    -   Put the created `Event` objects onto the `EventEngine` queue for system-wide distribution using the `on_tick` and `on_order` callback patterns.\n\n6.  **Error Handling:**\n    -   Wrap all `ccxt` calls in try/except blocks.\n    -   Catch specific `ccxt` exceptions (e.g., `AuthenticationError`, `InsufficientFunds`, `InvalidOrder`) and translate them into application-level `ErrorEvent` objects, which are then put on the `EventEngine` queue.",
        "testStrategy": "1.  **Unit Testing (Mocked CCXT):**\n    -   Create unit tests in `tests/unit/adapter/binance/`.\n    -   Use a mocking library to mock the `ccxt.binance` class.\n    -   **Transformation Tests:** Provide mock `ccxt` API responses and assert that the adapter's transformation logic produces the correct, fully-typed foxtrot data objects (`AccountData`, `OrderData`, `BarData`).\n    -   **Method Call Tests:** Call adapter methods like `send_order()` with a foxtrot `OrderRequest` and assert that the underlying `ccxt` methods are called with the correctly translated parameters.\n    -   **Error Handling Tests:** Configure the mock to raise `ccxt` exceptions and verify that the adapter handles them by putting a correctly formatted `ErrorEvent` on a mocked `EventEngine`.\n\n2.  **Integration Testing (Binance Testnet):**\n    -   Create a separate integration test suite that runs against the live Binance Spot Testnet.\n    -   Configure the tests to use dedicated testnet API keys stored securely as environment variables.\n    -   **Connectivity:** Test the `connect()` method to ensure successful authentication.\n    -   **Order Lifecycle:** Write a test that places a small limit order, verifies its status is 'open' via an `OrderEvent`, cancels the order, and verifies the final status is 'canceled' via another `OrderEvent`.\n    -   **Data Fetching:** Call `query_account()` and `query_market_data()` and validate the structure and types of the returned data objects against the framework's models.\n    -   **WebSocket Events:** Subscribe to a ticker (e.g., BTC/USDT) and order updates. Assert that correctly formatted `TickEvent` and `OrderEvent` objects are received via the `EventEngine` within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n3.  **Compatibility Testing:**\n    -   Execute an abstract, high-level test suite against both the existing IB adapter and the new Binance adapter to ensure they produce identical outputs and events for equivalent actions. This test is critical to validate the 'drop-in replacement' requirement and confirm strict interface compatibility.",

It will log thread counts and statuses.\n   - If a thread has terminated unexpectedly, the monitor will post a `THREAD_CRASHED` event to the `EventEngine`, including the thread's identity.

Assert that memory growth is minimal and not proportional to the number of iterations, confirming that objects are being garbage collected correctly.\n\n2. **Graceful Shutdown Testing:**\n   - Write an integration test that starts multiple mock adapters in separate threads and then triggers the application shutdown sequence.\n   - Verify that the `stop()` method is called on each adapter and that all threads are joined successfully within the timeout.\n   - Create a negative test with a 'rogue' mock adapter that intentionally ignores the stop signal. Assert that the shutdown process times out as expected, logs a critical error, and the main process still exits.\n\n3. **Thread Cleanup Unit Tests:**\n   - Write unit tests for the `StreamingBaseAdapter.disconnect()` method.\n   - Use mocks to verify that the underlying WebSocket client's `close()` method is called, the thread's `join()` method is invoked, and `EventEngine.unregister()` is called for all relevant event handlers.\n\n4. **Thread Monitor and Recovery Simulation:**\n   - Write a test where a mock adapter's thread is designed to crash after a few seconds.\n   - Assert that the `ThreadMonitor` detects the failure on its next check and correctly posts a `THREAD_CRASHED` event to the `EventEngine`.\n   - Create a mock listener for this event to verify that the recovery mechanism can be triggered.",

        "details": "This task involves a full overhaul of the TUI to ensure stability, reliability, and a seamless user experience. It addresses core architectural issues from async integration to state management.\n\n1. **Async/Await Integration:**\n   - Refactor all TUI interactions with the backend `EventEngine` to be fully asynchronous. Utilize `textual`'s `run_async` method to spawn background tasks for fetching data or dispatching actions without blocking the UI thread.\n   - Ensure the application's main `asyncio` event loop and the `textual` event loop are properly integrated to prevent conflicts and deadlocks.\n\n2. **Centralized State Management:**\n   - Implement a dedicated state management system (e.g., a singleton 'Store' class using an observable pattern) to act as the single source of truth for all UI components.\n   - Widgets will subscribe to state changes rather than holding their own state. This decouples UI components from business logic and simplifies data flow (e.g., `Store.subscribe('market_data', self.on_market_data_update)`).\n\n3. **Input Validation Framework:**\n   - Integrate `Pydantic` models for all user-configurable parameters (e.g., `TradeOrderModel`).\n   - Use `textual`'s built-in `Validator` objects on input fields for real-time client-side validation (e.g., checking for numeric input, valid symbol format).\n   - On submission, validate the input data against the Pydantic model and display clear, user-friendly error messages in a dedicated status area.\n\n4. **Race Condition Mitigation & Initialization:**\n   - Modify UI panels to initially render in a 'loading' state.\n   - Panels must subscribe to backend status events (e.g., `AdapterConnectedEvent`, `InitialStateLoadedEvent`) from the `EventEngine`.\n   - Only after receiving the appropriate 'ready' event should a panel request and render its data, preventing crashes due to uninitialized backend components.\n\n5. **Error Boundaries and Graceful Degradation:**\n   - Wrap widget update logic and event handlers in `try...except` blocks to catch unexpected errors and prevent a single widget failure from crashing the entire application. Log errors to a dedicated TUI log panel.\n   - Implement handlers for backend error/disconnection events. When a connection is lost, UI elements dependent on it should enter a 'disconnected' or 'stale data' state (e.g., grayed out, showing a warning icon) instead of failing.",
        "testStrategy": "Testing will focus on the interaction between the TUI and the backend systems, ensuring both functionality and stability under various conditions.\n\n1. **Component-Level Testing (Headless):**\n   - Use `textual.pilot` to test individual widgets and screens in isolation.\n   - For each widget, simulate user input (e.g., `pilot.press()`, `pilot.click()`) and assert the resulting state changes and visual output (via screen snapshots).\n   - Mock the state store to provide data and verify that the widget renders correctly for different states (loading, data-filled, error).\n\n2. **Integration Testing (TUI + Mocked Backend):**\n   - Create a test suite that runs the full TUI application in headless mode against a mocked `EventEngine`.\n   - **Backend-to-Frontend:** Simulate the `EventEngine` firing various events (`TickEvent`, `OrderUpdateEvent`, `AdapterErrorEvent`) and assert that the corresponding TUI widgets update their content and appearance correctly.\n   - **Frontend-to-Backend:** Use `pilot` to simulate user actions like placing an order. Verify that the correct action/event is dispatched to the mocked `EventEngine` with the validated parameters.\n\n3. **Race Condition and Stress Testing:**\n   - Develop a test that rapidly fires a sequence of connection, disconnection, and data events from the mocked `EventEngine` immediately upon TUI startup. Assert that the application remains stable and does not raise any unhandled exceptions.\n\n4. **Manual E2E Verification:**\n   - Create a testing checklist for manual verification against a live (or staging) backend.\n   - The checklist must include: verifying real-time data updates, successful order submission, correct display of error messages for invalid inputs, and graceful handling of a manual backend service restart.",

        "details": "This task involves a complete refactoring of the application's logging infrastructure to establish a modern, performant, and maintainable system.\n\n1. **Audit and Migrate to Loguru:**\n   - Perform a codebase-wide search for all instances of `print()`.\n   - Replace each `print()` statement with an appropriate `loguru` logger call (e.g., `logger.debug()`, `logger.info()`, `logger.warning()`, `logger.error()`).\n   - Differentiate between temporary debug prints, which should become `logger.debug()`, and essential operational messages, which should be `logger.info()` or higher.\n\n2. **Implement Structured Logging:**\n   - Configure `loguru` to serialize all log records to JSON format for file-based sinks. The console sink can remain human-readable for development.\n   - The standard JSON log entry must include: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `name`, `function`, and `line`.\n   - Utilize `logger.bind()` to add structured context to logs where appropriate (e.g., `logger.bind(exchange='binance', symbol='BTC/USDT').info('Order book updated')`).\n\n3. **Hot-Path Performance Optimization:**\n   - Identify performance-critical code paths, specifically within the WebSocket message handling loops (from Task 3) and the core `EventEngine`.\n   - Configure `loguru` sinks with `enqueue=True` to make logging calls in these hot-paths non-blocking, preventing I/O from impacting application latency.\n   - The default production log level should be set to `INFO` to avoid the performance cost of processing `DEBUG` level messages.\n\n4. **Centralized Configuration System:**\n   - Create a `logging.yaml` or similar configuration file to manage all logging settings.\n   - The application must load this configuration on startup.\n   - The configuration file will control sinks (file, console), log levels per module, format (JSON vs. plain text), rotation, and retention policies.\n\n5. **Log Rotation and Archival:**\n   - Configure file sinks to use built-in `loguru` rotation based on size (e.g., `rotation='100 MB'`) and time (e.g., `rotation='00:00'`).\n   - Implement a retention policy to automatically clean up old log files (e.g., `retention='14 days'`).\n   - Enable compression for rotated log files to save disk space (e.g., `compression='zip'`).\n\n6. **Performance Metrics Collection:**\n   - Establish a dedicated logger for performance metrics.\n   - This logger will write to a separate `metrics.log` file in a machine-parseable format (e.g., key-value or JSON).\n   - Instrument key functions to log execution time, e.g., `logger_metrics.info(f'event_processing_time={{duration}}ms')`.",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Static Code Analysis:**\n   - Run a script (`grep -r 'print(' ./src`) to verify that no `print()` statements remain in the main application source code. Exceptions for specific tools or scripts must be justified.\n\n2. **Structured Log Validation:**\n   - In unit tests, redirect log output to an in-memory stream (e.g., `io.StringIO`).\n   - Generate a log message with bound context using `logger.bind()`.\n   - Parse the resulting JSON from the stream and assert that all required fields (`timestamp`, `level`, `message`) and the custom context fields are present and correctly formatted.\n\n3. **Configuration Testing:**\n   - Write unit tests that load different logging configuration files.\n   - Assert that the logger's level and sink configurations change as expected based on the loaded file.\n   - Test edge cases like malformed configuration files, ensuring the application handles them gracefully.\n\n4. **Rotation and Retention Simulation:**\n   - Write an integration test that generates enough log data to trigger a size-based rotation. Verify that a new log file is created and the old one is archived/compressed.\n   - Use a library like `freezegun` to manipulate the system clock and test time-based rotation (e.g., daily) and retention (e.g., deleting files older than 7 days).\n\n5. **Performance Benchmarking:**\n   - Using the test infrastructure from Task 6, create benchmarks for a hot-path function (e.g., a WebSocket message handler).\n   - Run the benchmark with logging disabled, with synchronous logging, and with asynchronous (`enqueue=True`) logging.\n   - Assert that the performance degradation from asynchronous logging is minimal and within an acceptable threshold compared to synchronous logging.",

The focus of this subtask now shifts from the deleted `ibrokers_legacy.py` to the largest oversized file: `trading_panel.py` (1048 lines).\n\n**Analysis Summary:**\n- **Primary Issues:** The file violates the Single Responsibility Principle, exhibits high coupling, and mixes UI, business logic, and state management concerns. The `TUITradingPanel` class is a 670-line monolith.\n- **Decision:** Refactor `trading_panel.py` into a component-based structure following an MVC-like pattern.\n\n**Proposed Refactoring Structure:**\nA new directory will be created: `foxtrot/app/tui/components/trading/`\n- `trading_panel.py`: Main container widget (<150 lines).\n- `symbol_input.py`: `SymbolInput` widget and validation.\n- `order_preview.py`: `OrderPreviewPanel` and calculations.\n- `market_data.py`: `MarketDataPanel` and data handling.\n- `trading_controller.py`: Business logic and state management.\n- `trading_actions.py`: Order submission and event handling.\n- `form_manager.py`: Form validation and data binding.\n- `common.py`: Shared utilities and constants.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n1. Create the new directory structure.\n2. Extract components in dependency order.\n3. Implement a comprehensive testing strategy for new components.\n4. Ensure backward compatibility and no regressions.\n\nThis plan is approved. Implementation will proceed with an iterative, test-driven approach.\n</info added on 2025-08-06T16:10:15.123Z>\n</info added on 2025-08-06T16:29:46.027Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-06T16:38:54.894Z>\n**Implementation Complete: `trading_panel.py` Refactoring**\n\nThe refactoring of `trading_panel.py` has been successfully completed, achieving the primary objective of this subtask.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- **File Size Reduction:** The main `trading_panel.py` file was reduced from 1048 lines to 222 lines (a 79% reduction).\n- **Architectural Improvement:** A new component-based structure was implemented in `foxtrot/app/tui/components/trading/`, successfully separating UI, business logic, and state management concerns. This has significantly improved modularity, testability, and maintainability.\n- **Backward Compatibility:** All import paths were fixed to ensure no regressions in system integration.\n\n**New Refactoring Targets Identified:**\nThe initial refactoring has resulted in the creation of several new components that are still oversized and require further decomposition. These now become the next focus:\n- `trading_actions.py` (439 lines)\n- `market_data_panel.py` (428 lines)\n- `order_preview.py` (424 lines)\n- `form_manager.py` (366 lines)\n\n**Status:** The primary goal of breaking down the monolithic `trading_panel.py` is achieved.

Key patterns to look for include: WebSocket connection lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, reconnect), subscription/unsubscription message formatting, heartbeat handling (pings/pongs), and raw message parsing loops.\n\n2. **Create Reusable WebSocket Component:**\n   - In the `util/network/` directory (created in Task 26), implement a new `GenericWebSocketClient` class.\n   - This class will manage the entire WebSocket lifecycle, including auto-reconnection with exponential backoff, handling of `on_open`, `on_message`, `on_error`, and `on_close` events, and sending heartbeat messages.\n   - It should provide a simple API for sending subscription messages and allow the consumer (the adapter) to register a callback for processing incoming data payloads.\n\n3. **Develop a Base Adapter for Market Data:**\n   - Create a new abstract base class, `BaseMarketDataHandler`, which will utilize the `GenericWebSocketClient`.\n   - This base class will implement the boilerplate logic for connecting, subscribing to symbols, and handling WebSocket events. It will define abstract methods like `_get_subscription_payload(symbol)` and `_parse_message(payload)` that concrete adapters must implement.\n\n4. **Standardize Error Handling:**\n   - Integrate the custom exceptions from Task 22 (`ConnectionError`, `ValidationError`, etc.) into the `GenericWebSocketClient` and `BaseMarketDataHandler`.\n   - All network issues should raise a `ConnectionError`. Malformed messages from the exchange should raise a `DataError` or `ValidationError`. This ensures consistent error reporting across all adapters that use this base handler.\n\n5. **Refactor Concrete Adapters:**\n   - Modify `BinanceAdapter`, `FutuAdapter`, and other relevant adapters to inherit from `BaseMarketDataHandler`.\n   - Remove all duplicated WebSocket management and error handling logic, replacing it with calls to the base class methods.\n   - The refactored adapters should primarily contain exchange-specific logic: endpoint URLs, authentication methods, and the implementation of `_get_subscription_payload` and `_parse_message` to handle their unique data formats, transforming them into the application's internal data models (defined in Task 16).",

Verify that reconnection logic and heartbeat mechanisms trigger correctly.\n   - Test the `BaseMarketDataHandler` by mocking the `GenericWebSocketClient` and asserting that it correctly calls the abstract methods that a concrete adapter would implement.\n\n2. **Integration Testing for Refactored Adapters:**\n   - For each refactored adapter (e.g., `BinanceAdapter`), create integration tests that provide mock WebSocket messages (as JSON strings) to the `on_message` handler.\n   - Verify that the adapter's `_parse_message` implementation correctly transforms the exchange-specific payload into the standardized internal `MarketData` object and emits the correct event through the `EventEngine`.\n   - Use the shared test fixtures from Task 21 (`mock_event_engine`, etc.) to streamline these tests.\n\n3. **Error Handling Verification:**\n   - Write tests that simulate specific failure scenarios. For example, simulate a WebSocket connection failure and assert that a `ConnectionError` (from Task 22) is caught and logged appropriately. Simulate an invalid JSON payload and verify a `DataError` is raised.\n\n4. **Code Metrics and Regression:**\n   - Before and after refactoring, run a code duplication analysis tool (e.g., SonarQube, `pmd`) to quantify the reduction in duplicated code.\n   - The line count for `BinanceAdapter` and `FutuAdapter` should be reduced by at least 30-40%.\n   - Ensure that all existing unit and integration tests for the adapters continue to pass to guarantee no functional regressions have been introduced.",

        "details": "This task constitutes a major architectural refactoring to enforce project-wide directory structure standards. The work will be executed systematically across all identified monolithic directories.\n\n**1. Planning and File Mapping:**\n   - Create a definitive mapping document (e.g., a markdown file in the PR) that lists every file to be moved from the 10 source directories and its new destination subdirectory.\n   - The reorganization plan for key directories is as follows:\n     - `util/` (25 files): Reorganize into `util/core/` (logging, settings), `util/data/` (models, converters), `util/network/` (API clients, connection helpers), and `util/indicators/` (technical analysis functions).\n     - `event_adapter/` (15 files): Reorganize into `event_adapter/core/` (base classes, main loop), `event_adapter/commands/` (command objects), and `event_adapter/processors/` (event handlers).\n     - `trading/` (11 files): Reorganize by functionality into `trading/execution/`, `trading/strategies/`, and `trading/risk/`.\n     - `monitors/account/` (11 files): Implement a Facade pattern. Create a primary `monitors/account/facade.py` to expose a simple public interface, while moving the detailed implementation files into a new `monitors/account/_internal/` subdirectory.\n     - `adapter/binance/` (11 files): In coordination with Task 27, extract common patterns (e.g., WebSocket management, data transformation logic) into shared modules, potentially in a new `adapter/common/` directory or existing `util/network/` and `util/data/` directories.\n     - Other directories: Analyze the remaining 5 non-compliant directories and apply similar logical grouping based on functionality.\n\n**2. Phased Implementation:**\n   - It is recommended to tackle each top-level directory refactoring in a separate, short-lived feature branch to isolate changes and simplify code reviews.\n   - For each directory:\n     a. Create the new subdirectory structure.\n     b. Move the files according to the mapping plan.\n     c. Update all import statements within the moved files to use relative paths where appropriate.\n\n**3. Global Import Path Updates:**\n   - After moving files, perform a project-wide search-and-replace for all import statements affected by the changes. Utilize tools like `grep` and `sed`, or AST-aware refactoring tools like `bowler` or IDE features, to ensure all imports are updated correctly across the entire codebase, including application logic and test files.\n\n**4. Integration:**\n   - Sequentially merge the completed feature branches into a main integration branch for this task, resolving any conflicts.",
        "testStrategy": "**1. Pre-Refactor Baseline Establishment:**\n   - On the `main` branch before any changes, establish a baseline.\n   - Execute `pytest --collect-only` and save the output to a file. This captures the exact number and names of all tests.\n   - Execute the full test suite (`pytest`) and confirm a 100% pass rate. Save the test report and any performance benchmark data.\n\n**2. Post-Refactor Verification:**\n   - After all files are moved and imports are updated on the integration branch, repeat the baseline steps.\n   - Run `pytest --collect-only` again and use a diff tool to confirm the collected tests are identical to the baseline. No tests should be lost.\n   - Execute the full test suite. It must pass with 100% success. Compare performance benchmarks against the baseline to identify any significant regressions.\n\n**3. Static Analysis for Import Compliance:**\n   - Configure and run a static analysis tool (e.g., a custom linter script or a pre-commit hook) to scan the entire codebase for legacy import paths (e.g., `from util.some_module ...`).\n   - The build or CI pipeline must fail if any outdated import statements are detected, ensuring complete migration.\n\n**4. Code Review and Manual Inspection:**\n   - Conduct a thorough peer review of the final pull request. The review should focus on the logical consistency of the new directory structures.\n   - Manually inspect for any remaining commented-out code or old import statements that automated tools might have missed.",
