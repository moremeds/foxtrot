## Gap Analysis: Plans vs Tasks vs Implementation

### Implementation Status Mapping

| Component | Task Status | Actual Implementation | Gap Analysis |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **File Splitting** | ✅ Complete (Tasks 10-11) | ❌ Large files still exist | **VERIFICATION NEEDED** |
| **Test Infrastructure** | ✅ Complete (Tasks 13-14) | ❌ Cannot verify execution | **ENVIRONMENT ISSUE** |
| **WebSocket Streaming** | ✅ Complete (Task 3) | ✅ Code exists in binance/ | **ALIGNED** |
| **TUI Functionality** | ⏳ Pending (Tasks 5,17,18) | ❌ Non-functional per docs | **CRITICAL GAP** |
| **Adapter Implementation** | ✅ Complete (Task 1) | ✅ binance/ fully implemented | **ALIGNED** |

### Completed But Unmarked Tasks

**Potential Status Update Candidates:**
1. Some file splitting may be complete but not reflected in status
2. WebSocket implementation appears complete and functional
3. Test collection fixes may be working in proper environment

## Duplicate and Overlapping Tasks Analysis

### Document-Level Overlaps

| **State Persistence** | ✅ SQLite implementation | ✅ Advanced patterns | ❌ Not addressed | ❌ Not tasked |

### Task Consolidation Opportunities

**Duplicate Effort Areas:**
1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Tasks 6,13,14,19,21 overlap with all three plan approaches
2. **Architecture Cleanup**: Tasks 15,16,22 align with all plans but vary in complexity  
3. **TUI Development**: Task 5 overlaps with scattered UI improvements across plans

**Potential Merges:**
- Tasks 17-18 (TUI navigation/buttons) could be merged into Task 5 (TUI Implementation)
- Tasks 24,31 (directory refactoring) could be merged with completed Tasks 10-11
- Tasks 33-36 (test improvements) could be consolidated under Task 6

### Obsolete Tasks Identification

**Potentially Obsolete:**
- **Task 8-9**: WebSocket for Futu/IB adapters (Task 3 completed WebSocket generally)
- **Task 32**: Logging migration (should be covered by completed tasks)
- **Task 33**: Mock-based testing (redundant with Task 6 improvements)
