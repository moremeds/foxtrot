# Executive Summary: Foxtrot Realistic Improvement Plan

## Critical Finding

**The existing improvement plans are massively over-engineered.** They attempt to copy Nautilus Trader's production-grade features (circuit breakers, metrics systems, nanosecond precision) when Foxtrot doesn't even have working tests.

## Real Problems Found

1. **Code Organization Disaster**: Files with 1,290 lines (6x over the 200-line limit)
2. **Test Infrastructure Broken**: 0 tests actually run despite test files existing
3. **TUI Non-Functional**: UI doesn't respond to any user input
4. **Architectural Violations**: Global instances, circular dependencies, massive data clumps

## The Realistic Solution

### What We're NOT Doing
- ❌ NO Rust core or Cython extensions
- ❌ NO circuit breakers or metrics systems
- ❌ NO service locators or plugin architectures
- ❌ NO 90% test coverage targets
- ❌ NO production-grade features until basics work

### What We ARE Doing

**5 Phases, 8 Weeks, 80 Hours**

1. **Code Health** (Week 1-2): Split files, remove globals
2. **Test Infrastructure** (Week 3-4): Make tests run, add basic coverage
3. **Architecture Cleanup** (Week 5-6): Fix real problems, not add abstractions
4. **TUI Functionality** (Week 7): Make existing UI work, not rewrite it
5. **Integration** (Week 8): Ensure components work together

## Success Metrics

Clear, measurable outcomes:
- All files under 200 lines ✅
- Tests actually run ✅
- 50% coverage on critical paths ✅
- TUI responds to user input ✅
- No circular dependencies ✅

## Implementation Approach

Each improvement has a granular specification with:
- Problem statement
- Solution approach
- Success criteria
- Verification method
- Time estimate

See [specs/](./specs/) directory for all 15 specifications.

## Why This Plan is Better

1. **Addresses Real Problems**: Fixes actual issues instead of imaginary ones
2. **Achievable Goals**: 80 hours part-time vs 6 months full-time
3. **Verifiable Outcomes**: Each step has clear success criteria
4. **No Over-Engineering**: Simple solutions for a Python research platform
5. **Incremental Progress**: Value delivered every week

## Next Steps

1. **Approve this plan** - Replace the over-engineered plans
2. **Start immediately** - File splitting is critical (spec-01)
3. **Track progress** - Use simple checklist in master plan
4. **Resist scope creep** - No new features until Phase 5 complete

## Bottom Line

Foxtrot needs its foundation fixed, not production features copied from Nautilus. This plan delivers a working platform in 8 weeks instead of an over-engineered system that never ships.
