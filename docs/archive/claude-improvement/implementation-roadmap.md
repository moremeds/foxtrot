# Foxtrot Implementation Roadmap

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 6, 2025

## Overview

This document provides a detailed implementation roadmap for transforming Foxtrot from a basic trading platform into a production-ready system inspired by Nautilus Trader's engineering excellence. The roadmap spans 6 months with clear phases, priorities, and success metrics.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phased Approach Rationale

The implementation follows a three-phase approach designed to:

1. **Build Strong Foundations** (Months 1-2): Establish testing, error handling, and monitoring
2. **Achieve Production Readiness** (Months 3-4): Add risk management, persistence, and resilience 
3. **Deliver Advanced Features** (Months 5-6): Complete with advanced data processing and backtesting

This approach ensures each phase delivers value while building towards the complete vision.
