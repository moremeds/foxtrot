● Summary

  I've successfully reviewed and enhanced the WebSocket streaming implementation task (Task #3) using the CCXT.pro manual. Here's what was accomplished:

  1. Comprehensive Analysis

  - Created detailed investigation, flow analysis, and implementation plan documents in ./docs/claude/claude-instance-websocket-design/
  - task definition in .taskmaster/tasks/task_003.txt
  - Analyzed current HTTP polling implementation and designed WebSocket replacement strategy
  - Identified key technical decisions to maintain backward compatibility

  2. Updated Task and Subtasks

  - Enhanced the main task with detailed implementation insights from CCXT.pro manual
  - Updated all subtasks with specific technical implementation details
  - Added two new subtasks for comprehensive testing and production deployment

  3. Key Design Decisions

  - No Breaking Changes: Maintain BaseAdapter interface compatibility
  - Async-Threading Bridge: Use dedicated asyncio thread for WebSocket operations
  - Exponential Backoff: 1s → 60s max reconnection strategy
  - Feature Flags: Gradual per-symbol rollout capability
  - Circuit Breaker: Automatic HTTP fallback on persistent failures

  4. Implementation Phases

  - Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)
  - Phase 2: Core WebSocket Implementation (3-4 weeks)
  - Phase 3: Testing & Validation (2-3 weeks)
  - Phase 4: Production Deployment (1-2 weeks)

  5. Created Implementation Tracking

  - Set up 16 detailed todos covering all implementation phases
  - Prioritized tasks for optimal development flow
  - Ready to begin with Phase 1 foundation work
