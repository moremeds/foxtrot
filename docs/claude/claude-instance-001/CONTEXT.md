# Task Context for Thread Management Update

## Overview
This document provides context for updating Task 4 (Thread Management and Graceful Shutdown) based on the completed Task 3 (WebSocket Streaming Implementation).

## Task 3 Summary (COMPLETED)
Task 3 successfully implemented WebSocket streaming to replace HTTP polling:

### Key Components Introduced:
1. **AsyncThreadBridge** (`foxtrot/util/websocket_utils.py`)
   - Bridges asyncio WebSocket operations with threading model
   - Manages dedicated asyncio event loop in separate thread
   - Provides thread-safe event emission
   - Uses daemon thread for event loop

2. **WebSocketManager** (`foxtrot/adapter/binance/websocket_manager.py`)
   - Manages WebSocket connection lifecycle
   - Implements auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Tracks subscriptions for restoration after reconnect
   - Monitors connection health with heartbeat

3. **WebSocketErrorHandler** (`foxtrot/adapter/binance/error_handler.py`)
   - Classifies errors and determines recovery strategies
   - Implements circuit breaker pattern for HTTP fallback
   - Tracks error statistics

4. **Enhanced BinanceMarketData** (`foxtrot/adapter/binance/market_data.py`)
   - Dual-mode operation (WebSocket/HTTP)
   - Uses ccxtpro for WebSocket streaming
   - Maintains backward compatibility

### Performance Achievements:
- Latency: ~33ms (exceeded <200ms target)
- Update rate: 10+ updates/second (vs 1/second with HTTP)
- Full backward compatibility maintained

## Task 4 Requirements (PENDING)
Task 4 aims to address critical stability issues:

### Core Objectives:
1. **Memory Leak Remediation**
   - Fix reference cycles in event handlers
   - Ensure proper garbage collection of adapters
   - Implement explicit deregistration

2. **Graceful Shutdown Mechanism**
   - Central shutdown hook for SIGINT/SIGTERM
   - Thread termination with configurable timeout
   - Force exit if threads don't terminate

3. **Robust Thread Cleanup**
   - Make disconnect() idempotent
   - Ensure WebSocket client closure
   - Release all resources properly

4. **Thread Monitoring System**
   - ThreadMonitor daemon service
   - Registry of critical threads
   - Automatic crash detection and recovery

## Threading Challenges from Task 3

### New Threading Complexity:
1. **AsyncThreadBridge Thread**
   - Runs event loop in daemon thread
   - Needs proper shutdown sequence
   - Must cancel all pending asyncio tasks

2. **WebSocket Connection Threads**
   - Persistent connections require careful lifecycle management
   - Auto-reconnection creates additional thread management complexity
   - Multiple concurrent WebSocket streams per adapter

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - Daemon threads may not cleanup properly on shutdown
   - AsyncIO tasks may be orphaned if not cancelled
   - WebSocket reconnection may create thread proliferation
   - Circuit breaker state needs thread-safe access

### Memory Leak Risks:
1. Event handler registration without deregistration
2. AsyncIO tasks holding references to adapters
3. WebSocket subscription callbacks creating cycles
4. Error handler statistics accumulating indefinitely

## Update Requirements for Task 4

Task 4 needs to be updated to specifically address:

1. **AsyncThreadBridge Lifecycle**
   - Proper shutdown of asyncio event loop
   - Cancellation of all pending tasks
   - Thread join with timeout

2. **WebSocket-Specific Cleanup**
   - Close all WebSocket connections gracefully
   - Cancel reconnection attempts on shutdown
   - Clear subscription registrations

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Track AsyncThreadBridge health
   - Monitor WebSocket connection threads
   - Detect orphaned asyncio tasks

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test shutdown with active WebSocket streams
   - Verify no threads/tasks are leaked
   - Validate memory is properly released
