# Foxtrot TUI Phase 3 Implementation Plan
## Interactive Trading Interface Development Strategy

### Executive Summary

This comprehensive implementation plan outlines the development strategy for Phase 3 of the Foxtrot TUI project - the Interactive Trading Interface. Based on detailed investigation and flow analysis, this plan provides a roadmap for implementing full trading functionality while leveraging the solid foundation established in Phases 1 and 2.

**Project Status**: Phases 1 (Core Infrastructure) and 2 (Data Display) are complete. Phase 3 requires focused development on interactive components.

**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks of focused development
**Risk Level**: Medium (well-architected foundation mitigates most risks)
**Success Criteria**: Full trading functionality through TUI interface

```

#### Week 2: Order Submission Pipeline

**Priority**: High - Core functionality completion

**Files to Modify**:
- `foxtrot/app/tui/integration/event_adapter.py` - Add command publishing
- `foxtrot/app/tui/main_app.py` - Add order confirmation dialogs

**EventEngineAdapter Extensions**:
```python
# New Methods to Add:
async def publish_command(self, command_type: str, data: dict) -> None:
    """Publish command to MainEngine via event system"""
    
async def subscribe_command_response(self, callback: Callable) -> None:
    """Subscribe to command response events"""
    
async def validate_order_params(self, order_data: dict) -> ValidationResult:
    """Validate order parameters with real-time data"""
```

**Order Flow Implementation**:
1. User completes order form with real-time validation
2. Order preview displays calculated cost and risk
3. User confirms order submission
4. EventEngineAdapter publishes order command
5. MainEngine processes order through existing system
6. Order status updates flow back through event system
7. OrderMonitor displays new order in real-time

### Phase 3.2: Dialog System Infrastructure (Weeks 3-4)

#### Week 3: Base Dialog Framework

**Priority**: High - Infrastructure for configuration management

**Files to Create**:
```
foxtrot/app/tui/dialogs/
├── __init__.py                 # Dialog system exports
├── base.py                     # Base dialog classes
├── forms.py                    # Form-based dialogs
└── modals.py                   # Modal management system
```

**Base Dialog Classes**:
```python
class TUIDialog(ModalScreen):
    """Base dialog with common functionality"""
    # Standard dialog behavior, ESC handling, focus management
    
class FormDialog(TUIDialog):
    """Form-based dialog with validation"""
    # Form rendering, validation integration, submit/cancel
    
class SelectionDialog(TUIDialog):
    """List selection dialog"""
    # Searchable lists, multi-select support, keyboard navigation
    
class ConfirmationDialog(TUIDialog):
    """Yes/No confirmation dialog"""
    # Simple confirmation with customizable messages
```

**Modal Management System**:
```python
class ModalManager:
    """Centralized modal dialog management"""
    # Dialog stack management, focus handling, cleanup
```

#### Week 3-4: Specialized Dialogs

**Connection Management Dialogs**:

**`foxtrot/app/tui/dialogs/connection.py`**:
```python
class GatewayConnectionDialog(FormDialog):
    """Gateway connection configuration"""
    # Dynamic form generation based on gateway requirements
    # Secure credential input with masking
    # Connection testing and validation
    # Gateway-specific settings (IB port, Binance API keys)
    
class ConnectionStatusDialog(TUIDialog):
    """Real-time connection monitoring"""
    # Connection status display
    # Reconnection controls
    # Error message display
```

**Settings Management**:

**`foxtrot/app/tui/dialogs/settings.py`**:
```python
class TUISettingsDialog(FormDialog):
    """TUI-specific preferences"""
    # Color scheme selection
    # Update frequency settings
    # Default order parameters
    # Performance options (row limits, etc.)
    # Layout preferences
```

**Contract Management**:

**`foxtrot/app/tui/dialogs/contract.py`**:
```python
class ContractManagerDialog(TUIDialog):
    """Symbol search and contract management"""
    # Symbol search with filtering
    # Contract information display
    # Symbol selection for trading panel
    # Favorites management
```

#### Week 4: Integration and Persistence

```

---

## 3. Technical Architecture Details

### 3.1 Event System Integration

**Command Publishing Pattern**:
```python
# EventEngineAdapter Extension
async def publish_order_command(self, order_data: OrderData) -> str:
    """Publish order command and return order ID"""
    command_event = Event(EVENT_ORDER_COMMAND, order_data)
    await self._publish_to_main_thread(command_event)
    return order_data.orderid
```

**Response Handling**:
```python
# Order Status Updates
def on_order_event(self, event: Event) -> None:
    """Handle order status updates"""
    order_data = event.data
    # Update UI with order status changes
    # Provide user notifications for order execution
```

### 3.2 Data Flow Architecture

**Interactive Command Flow**:
```
User Input → Validation → Order Preview → Confirmation → 
EventEngineAdapter → MainEngine → Broker API → 
Status Updates → Event System → UI Updates
```

**Thread Safety Maintenance**:
- All UI operations in main Textual thread
- All MainEngine operations in EventEngine thread
- EventEngineAdapter provides thread-safe bridge
- No direct cross-thread data sharing

### 3.3 Performance Optimization

**Real-time Update Throttling**:
```python
class ThrottledUpdater:
    """Throttle high-frequency updates"""
    # Rate limiting for market data updates
    # Batch processing for multiple updates
    # Priority queuing for critical updates
```

**Memory Management**:
- Extend existing row limit patterns
- Implement dialog cleanup on close
- Cache management for market data
- Garbage collection for completed orders
