### Technical Debt
- **Empty Directories**: `dialogs/` and `layout/` directories contain only placeholder files
- **Incomplete Integration**: Trading panel has no integration with order management system
- **Missing Validation**: No input validation framework exists
- **Static UI Elements**: Many UI components are static text rather than interactive widgets
