## Conclusion

The Foxtrot trading platform has a solid architectural foundation with good testing patterns established for the Binance adapter. However, critical gaps exist in core system testing, particularly the EventEngine and MainEngine components. The recommended testing strategy focuses on systematic coverage improvement, starting with the core event system and expanding to complete adapter coverage.

The existing mock infrastructure provides an excellent foundation for realistic testing scenarios. With the proposed enhancements, the platform can achieve comprehensive test coverage while maintaining the flexibility needed for a production trading system.

Priority should be given to testing the core event system and Interactive Brokers adapter, as these represent the highest risk areas with current zero test coverage. The modular architecture makes incremental testing implementation straightforward and maintainable.
